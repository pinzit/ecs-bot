<h2 align="center">This program is designed to continuously join and leave an ECS:R game of your choice every 10 minutes, which gives you 60 tix.</h2>

To run this you need your <code>.ROBLOSECURITY</code> (ECS, not Roblox) and you need a place id. You can use any game, but games with 0 players may return an ID 17.
